# Codex Memory Log

This file is the single, persistent project memory for Codex-assisted work.

- Before starting any task, read this file first.
- After every merged PR, append a new entry using the template below.
- Do not rewrite previous entries except to fix factual mistakes.
- Keep entries concise and operational (what changed, why, risks, follow-ups).

## Entry template
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — PR #<number> — <short title>
- Summary:
  - <1-3 bullets of what shipped>
- Validation:
  - <tests/checks run>
- Follow-ups:
  - <open tasks or "none">
- Risks/notes:
  - <migration steps, rollback notes, caveats>
```

## 2026-02-12 — PR #TBD — Introduce persistent Codex memory log
- Summary:
  - Added this canonical memory file for Codex agents to keep merged work history.
  - Linked the file from `README.md` so contributors can find and maintain it.
- Validation:
  - `python -m pytest` (from `voxera-os-scaffold/voxera-os`) passed.
- Follow-ups:
  - Replace `#TBD` with the real PR number after merge.
- Risks/notes:
  - Process-only change; no runtime behavior changed.

## 2026-02-15 — PR #TBD — Add cloud-assisted mission planning path
- Summary:
  - Added `voxera missions plan` to let the configured cloud brain draft a mission from a natural-language goal.
  - Added strict planner validation so only known skill IDs and JSON outputs are accepted before execution.
  - Updated mission docs and added root-level `AGENT.md`/`CODEX.md` memory pointers for operator continuity.
- Validation:
  - `pytest -q`
- Follow-ups:
  - Add provider fallback selection for planning (`primary` -> `fast`/`fallback`) when cloud requests fail.
  - Add tests for policy deny + approval rejection paths on cloud-planned missions.
- Risks/notes:
  - Cloud planner quality depends on model behavior; guardrails reject malformed output.

## 2026-02-16 — PR #TBD — Rewrite unsafe non-explicit sandbox.exec planner steps
- Summary:
  - Added planner-side safety rewrite for non-explicit goals so `sandbox.exec` steps using host-GUI/sandbox-inappropriate tools (`xdotool`, `wmctrl`, `xprop`, `gdbus`, `curl`, `wget`) are converted into `clipboard.copy` manual confirmation prompts.
  - Kept explicit user shell-command intent intact so command-oriented goals still allow planner `sandbox.exec` output.
  - Updated docs to describe the new planner guardrail behavior and aligned note-path examples with `~/VoxeraOS/notes`.
- Validation:
  - `pytest -q tests/test_mission_planner.py tests/test_queue_daemon.py`
- Follow-ups:
  - Add telemetry/metrics on rewrite frequency to detect planner drift.
- Risks/notes:
  - Intent detection is heuristic and should be monitored for false positives/negatives.


## 2026-02-21 — PR #TBD — Queue failed-artifact reliability pass
- Summary:
  - Added a stable failed-sidecar contract with schema versioning (`schema_version=1`) and required fields (`job`, `error`, `timestamp_ms`) plus optional `payload`.
  - Added strict sidecar validation on write/read paths and ensured all queue failure paths emit schema-compliant sidecars.
  - Added deterministic failed-artifact retention pruning that treats primary+sidecar as one logical unit, handles orphans predictably, and supports max-age/max-count while preserving newest failures.
- Validation:
  - `pytest -q tests/test_queue_daemon.py tests/test_cli_queue.py`
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider adding a first-class CLI command to inspect/prune failed retention state.
- Risks/notes:
  - Invalid legacy sidecars are intentionally ignored for status summaries and logged via `queue_failed_sidecar_invalid`.


## 2026-02-21 — PR #TBD — Tighten sidecar schema policy + lifecycle smoke coverage
- Summary:
  - Centralized failed-sidecar schema version checks with explicit writer pin (`1`) and reader allowlist (`[1]`).
  - Added deterministic rejection handling for unknown/future sidecar versions while preserving `queue_failed_sidecar_invalid` audit signaling.
  - Added a queue failure lifecycle smoke test validating fail -> sidecar-preferred snapshot -> prune -> empty snapshot behavior.
- Validation:
  - `pytest -q tests/test_queue_daemon.py`
  - `pytest -q tests/test_cli_queue.py`
- Follow-ups:
  - If a future schema bump is needed, update writer pin + reader allowlist together and document migration path before rollout.
- Risks/notes:
  - Mixed-version sidecars now surface deterministically as invalid until compatibility is explicitly added.
